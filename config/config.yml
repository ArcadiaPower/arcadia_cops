  # All cops except the ones in disabled.yml are enabled by default. Change
  # this behavior by overriding DisabledByDefault. When DisabledByDefault is
  # true, all cops in the default configuration are disabled, and and only cops
  # in user configuration are enabled. This makes cops opt-in instead of
  # opt-out. Note that when DisabledByDefault is true, cops in user
  # configuration will be enabled even if they don't set the Enabled parameter.

  # writable by any system user. This means that it is possible for a
  # malicious user to anticipate the location of Rubocop's cache directory,
  # and create a symlink in its place that could cause Rubocop to overwrite
  # unintended files, or read malicious input. If you are certain that your
  # cache location is secure from this kind of attack, and wish to use a
  # symlinked cache location, set this value to "true".
