Arcadia Power Rubocop Configuration
===================================

## Dev

All cops used configured specifically for our style guides, intended for use against new feature branches. Initially will have many "offenses" on the codebase overall.

## CI

Limited number of passing rules used integrated into codeship CI to fail a build. Goal of migrating additional cops from the larger dev list into the CI list.
